# Templates

Using json-variables you can use JSON files as templates along with variables to automate AXL operations.

## Update Phone and Line

Every wanted to change an exsiting phone from one user to another user? This script will help you do that as well as updating all the display, line text labels, etc for the new user.

## Add Phone and Update Line

This script will add a new phone and line. Once finished it will go back and update the line. AXL doesn't allow setting alertingName, asciiAlertingName and description while adding a line via the addPhone operation. This would be similar to using BAT to add phones.
