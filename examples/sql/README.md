# SQL Queries

Use **cisco-axl** to save SQL queries and execute whenever needed. sqlQuery.js will read in an ".sql" file and run the query for you. Just export the results to a csv or use in another operation.

The **fs.readFileSync** package will allow a more readable format to be read in and still able executed with the **executeSQLQuery** operation. This makes it easy to store useful queries and script them to run.

I've included examples of some useful queries.
